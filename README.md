# On-Premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)

This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.

## **Environments and Technologies Used**
- **Microsoft Azure:** Virtual Machines/Compute
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**

## **Operating Systems Used**
- **Windows Server 2022:** 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM
- **Windows 10 Pro (22H2):** 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM

---

## **High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps**
1. Install Active Directory on DC-1
2. Create a Domain Admin user for the domain
3. Join Client-1 to the domain

---
## Deployment and Configuration Steps

We'll set up two VMs on Azure: DC-1 as a Windows Server for the domain controller and Client-1 as a Windows Pro client. Both machines will be connected to the same virtual network. After that, we'll log into DC-1 to proceed.


![Active 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e5e91c-8833-4a08-a4b3-dfe2aebd89cc)

Server Manager should open automatically; if not, click Start and select the Server Manager icon. Choose "Add Roles and Features," keep the defaults, and select "Active Directory Domain Services" under Server Roles.

![Active 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/069c5232-6586-4789-9298-053490b17f63)

Check "Restart the destination server automatically if required," then click "Install." Once the installation is complete, return to Server Manager and click the flagged icon in the top-right corner. Select "Promote this server to a domain controller."

![Active 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5bc705-73d7-4256-af1b-6557f330ebb2)

In the Deployment Configuration, select "Add a new forest" and enter mydomain.com (or any domain name you prefer).

![Active 9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f55ee1b-a38d-4fb0-a485-aac7002be536)

Click "Next" and set a Directory Services Restore Mode password (you can choose anything, as itâ€™s rarely used). Continue the configuration, and the system will automatically sign you out as Active Directory finishes installation.

Next, log into the Client-1 machine. Logging in with your usual credentials will fail because no domain is specified. Instead, use: mydomain.com\your-username and enter your password.

Once logged in, switch back to DC-1. The next step is to create a Domain Admin user. This role manages the entire domain and is critical. Click Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers. Right-click mydomain.com -> New -> Organizational Unit (OU).

![Active 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/466aa126-d7bf-45d4-b94d-5a8c91961109)

Name the new OUs _EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS. To create an admin user, right-click _ADMINS -> New -> User. Name the user Jane Doe with the username jane_admin, and set a password of your choice.

Although Jane Doe is in the _ADMINS OU, she isn't a Domain Admin yet. To grant those privileges, click on _ADMINS, right-click Jane Doe, and select Properties -> Member Of. Type Domain Admins in the box, click Check Names, then OK, and apply the settings.

![Active 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d343d9c6-8565-41b5-bee5-9e370966ac5c)

Next, update Client-1's DNS settings to point to the private IP address of DC-1. This ensures proper communication within the domain.

![Active 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fa6ff9-9a76-4053-9354-fda200fa61a8)

Log back into Client-1 as Jane using mydomain.com\jane_admin and your password. Right-click the Start menu -> Settings -> Rename this PC (advanced). Under Computer Name, click Change, select Domain, and enter mydomain.com, then click OK.

![Active 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99991c2-17ef-4c3f-9960-17c9febd5d5e)

Restart Client-1 to apply the changes. Return to DC-1 and open Active Directory Users and Computers. Click on mydomain.com -> Computers, and you should see Client-1 listed, confirming it has joined the domain.
